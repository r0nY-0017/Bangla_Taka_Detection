Automated Bangladeshi Taka Recognition systems improve accessibility and the effectiveness of financial transactions for people with visual impairments. Three machine learning models—Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—are thoroughly com- pared in this study to identify Bangladeshi Taka notes in seven
different denominations (10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 Taka). A carefully selected dataset of 1,400 photos taken in various real- world scenarios was used. While RF and SVM underperformed at 38.2% and 45.6%, respectively, the CNN model attained an exceptional accuracy of 99.8%. In addition to graphical assessments and class-wise evaluations, this work describes the dataset construction, preprocessing, model architectures, training processes, and performance measures. The results demonstrate CNN’s dominance in managing intricate visual patterns and point out real-world issues and future directions for real-time currency recognition.

# How to Run this Project:
1. Clone or Download this Project First.
2. Then, Create Dataset like me & Named the Dataset folder "Taka_Images"
3. Then normally you can run the "Feature_Extraction" File in Models\CNN Folder. After running this you must download neccessary libraries first.
4. Then you Run app file . you can see an interface where you can select an image & model predict the output like screenshot.
5. Thats it. Thank You
